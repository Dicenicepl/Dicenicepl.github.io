            <h3>File Sorter</h3>
            <p>A desktop application, was developed in Java, leveraging well-known libraries such as JavaFX and File. I contributed to the project from its inception, adding new functionalities and ensuring application robustness by addressing errors. Initially, we allowed users to choose a location where the software would create a directory to organize files placed within it based on user-set time parameters. Depending on the selected sorting method, which includes sorting by:
            <br>- Initial letters
            <br>- Creation date (yyyy-mm)
            <br>- Extensions
            <br>The application generated subdirectories based on the specified variable and moved files accordingly.</p>
